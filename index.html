<p>Jellyfish or jellies are softbodied, free-swimming aquatic animals with a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell &amp; trailing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentacle">tentacles</a>. The bell can pulsate to acquire propulsion and locomotion. The tentacles may be utilized to capture prey or defend against predators by emitting toxins in a painful sting. Jellyfish species are classified in the subphylum <i>Medusozoa</i> which makes up a major part of the phylum <i>Cnidaria</i>, although not all Medusozoa species are considered to be jellyfish.</p>
<p>Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea. <strong>Scyphozoans (the "true jellyfish") are exclusively marine</strong>, and some hydrozoans with a similar appearance live in freshwater. Large, often colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide. Jellyfish have roamed the seas for at least 500 million years, and possibly 700 million years or more, making them the oldest multi-organ animal.</p>

<p>The popular English name <strong>jellyfish</strong> has been in use since 1796. It has traditionally also been applied to other animals sharing a superficial resemblance, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctenophores" title="Ctenophores">ctenophores</a> (members from another phylum of common, gelatinous and generally transparent or translucent, free-swimming planktonic carnivores now known as <em>comb jellies</em>) were included as "jellyfishes". Even some scientists include the phylum ctenophora when they are referring to jellyfish. Other scientists prefer to use the more all-encompassing term <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatinous_zooplankton" title="Gelatinous zooplankton">gelatinous zooplankton</a></em>, when referring to these, together with other soft-bodied animals in the water column.</p>

<p>As jellyfish are not true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a>, the word <em>jellyfish</em> is considered by some to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnomer" title="Misnomer">misnomer</a>. Public aquaria often use the terms <em>jellies</em> or <em>sea jellies</em> instead. The term "jellies" may have become more popular than "jellyfish". In scientific literature, "jelly" and "jellyfish" are often used interchangeably. Some sources may use the term "jelly" to refer to organisms in this taxon, as "jellyfish" may be considered inappropriate.</p>

<p>Many textbooks and sources refer to only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphozoa" title="Scyphozoa">scyphozoans</a> as "true jellyfish".</p>
<h3><span id="Bloom">Bloom</span></h3>
<p>A group of jellyfish is sometimes called a <strong>bloom</strong> or a swarm. "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom" title="Algal bloom">Bloom</a>" is usually used for a large group of jellyfish that gather in a small area, but may also have a time component, referring to seasonal increases, or numbers beyond what was expected. Other collective names for a group of jellyfish are "fluther" and "smack," though neither term is commonly used by scientists who study jellyfish. Jellyfish are "bloomy" by nature of their life cycles, being produced by their benthic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp" title="Polyp">polyps</a> usually in the spring when sunshine and plankton increase, so they appear rather suddenly and often in large numbers, even when an ecosystem is in balance. Using "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm" title="Swarm">swarm</a>" usually implies some kind of active ability to stay together, which a few species such as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelia_(genus)" title="Aurelia (genus)">Aurelia</a></em>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_jelly" title="Moon jelly">moon jelly</a>, demonstrate.</p>

<p>Medusa jellyfish may be classified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphozoa" title="Scyphozoa">scyphomedusae</a> ("true" jellyfish), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stauromedusae" title="Stauromedusae">stauromedusae</a> (stalked jellyfish), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_jellyfish" title="Box jellyfish">cubomedusae</a> (box jellyfish), or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydromedusae" title="Hydromedusae">hydromedusae</a>, according to which clade their species belongs.</p>

<h3><span id="Medusa">Medusa</span></h3>
<p><span id="term_medusa"> </span>The term <strong>medusa</strong> was coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in 1752, alluding to the tentacled head of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa" title="Medusa">Medusa</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>. This term refers exclusively to the non-polyp life-stage which occurs in many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria" title="Cnidaria">cnidarians</a>, which is typified by a large pulsating gelatinous bell with long trailing tentacles. All medusa-producing species belong to the sub-phylum Medusozoa.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a>, a <em>medusa</em> (plural: medusae) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_(zoology)" title="Form (zoology)">form</a> of cnidarian in which the body is shaped like an umbrella, in contrast with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp" title="Polyp">polyps</a>. Medusae vary from bell-shaped to the shape of a thin disk, scarcely convex above and only slightly concave below. The upper or aboral surface is called the <em>exumbrella</em> and the lower surface is called the <em>subumbrella</em>; the mouth is located on the lower surface, which may be partially closed by a membrane extending inward from the margin (called the <em>velum</em>). The digestive cavity consists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrovascular_cavity" title="Gastrovascular cavity">gastrovascular cavity</a> and radiating canals which extend toward the margin; these canals may be simple or branching, and vary in number from few to many. The margin of the disk bears sensory organs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentacle" title="Tentacle">tentacles</a>.</p>
<p>German biologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel" title="Ernst Haeckel">Ernst Haeckel</a> popularized medusae through his vivid illustrations, particularly in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunstformen_der_Natur" title="Kunstformen der Natur">Kunstformen der Natur</a></em>.</p>

<b>Size</b>
<p>Jellyfish range from about one millimeter in bell height and diameter to nearly 2 <abbr title="metres">m</abbr> (6.6 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) in bell height and diameter; the tentacles and mouth parts usually extend beyond this bell dimension.</p>

<p>The smallest jellyfish are the peculiar creeping jellyfish in the genera Staurocladia and Eleutheria, which have bell disks from 0.5 <abbr title="millimetres">mm</abbr> to a few millimeters in diameter, with short tentacles that extend out beyond this, which these jellyfish use to move across the surface of seaweed or the bottoms of rocky pools. Many of these tiny creeping jellyfish cannot be seen in the field without a hand lens or microscope; they can reproduce asexually by splitting in half (called fission). Other very small jellyfish, which have bells about one millimeter, are the hydromedusae of many species that have just been released from their parent polyps; some of these live only a few minutes before shedding their gametes in the plankton and then dying, while others will grow in the plankton for weeks or months. The hydromedusae Cladonema radiatum and Cladonema californicum are also very small, living for months, yet never growing beyond a few mm in bell height and diameter. Another small species of jellyfish is the Australian Irukandji, which is about the size of a fingernail.</p>

<p>The lion's mane jellyfish, Cyanea capillata, was long-cited as the largest jellyfish, and arguably the longest animal in the world, with fine, thread-like tentacles that may extend up to 36.5 metres (120 ft) long (though most are nowhere near that large). They have a moderately painful, but rarely fatal, sting.</p>

<p>The increasingly common giant Nomura's jellyfish, Nemopilema nomurai, found in some, but not all years in the waters of Japan, Korea and China in summer and autumn is another candidate for "largest jellyfish", in terms of diameter and weight, since the largest Nomura's jellyfish in late autumn can reach 200 centimetres (79 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) in bell (body) diameter and about 200 kilograms (440 lb) in weight, with average specimens frequently reaching 90 centimetres (35 in) in bell diameter and about 150 kilograms (330 lb) in weight. The large bell mass of the giant Nomura's jellyfish can dwarf a diver and is nearly always much greater than the up-to-100 centimetres (39 in) bell diameter Lion's Mane.</p>

<p>The rarely encountered deep-sea jellyfish Stygiomedusa gigantea is another candidate for "largest jellyfish", with its thick, massive bell up to 100 centimetres (39 in) wide, and four thick, "strap-like" oral arms extending up to 6 metres (20 ft) in length, very different from the typical fine, threadlike tentacles that rim the umbrella of more-typical-looking jellyfish, including the Lion's Mane.</p>

<summary>Diet</summary>
<p>Medusae are carnivorous, feeding on plankton, crustaceans, fish eggs, small fish and other jellyfish, ingesting and voiding through the same hole in the middle of the bell. Jellies hunt passively using their tentacles as drift nets. Their swimming technique also helps them to capture prey; when their body expands it displaces more water which brings more potential prey within the reach of their tentacles.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Predation</summary>
<p>Other species of jellyfish are among the most common and important jellyfish predators, some of which specialize in jellies. Sea anemones may eat jellyfish that drift into their range. Other predators include tunas, sharks, swordfish, sea turtles, penguins, and at least one species of Pacific salmon. In general however, there are few predators preying on jellyfish and they can be considered top predators in the food chain. Not only do they eat fish eggs and juvenile fish, but they also compete for food resources, leading to jellyfish having a difficult-to-reverse dominant position in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Sea birds sometimes pick symbiotic crustaceans from the jellyfish bells near the sea's surface, inevitably feeding also on the jellyfish hosts of these amphipods or young crabs and shrimp.</p>
